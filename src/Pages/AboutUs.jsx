            The Pokémon anime series was largely credited for allowing anime to become more popular and familiar around the world,
            especially in the United States, where the two highest-grossing anime films are both Pokémon films.[5] It was also considered to
            be one of the first anime series on television to reach this level of mainstream success with Western audiences,as well as being
            credited with allowing the game series to reach such a degree of popularity, and vice versa. Pokémon is regarded as the most
            successful video game adaptation of all time, with over 1,000 episodes broadcast and adapted for international television
            markets, concurrently airing in 169 countries worldwide, and one of the most widely watched shows on Netflix, as of 2016.
